# Character-creator

## Description


This site allows the users to select a character from three different genres. Once you select your character, or pick a character already generated in the database, you are asked a series of prompts that aid in building a story line template to your liking. The reason this project was created was to help aid creators when blockers, creative paralysis and or writers block occures. This site helps in pushing our users out that paralysis muck an on the way to tp the creativity train.
